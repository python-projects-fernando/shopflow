feat(application): implement PlaceOrderUseCase with clean dependencies

- Add PlaceOrderUseCase in application/use_cases.py
- Orchestrate order creation using Customer and Order entities
- Depend only on domain abstractions (IOrderRepository, INotificationSender)
- Respect aggregate boundaries: fetch Customer by ID from separate aggregate
- Use built-in list generics and remove unused imports

Completes application layer with pure business logic, ready for dependency injection.
