feat(domain): define core entities and interfaces for ShopFlow

- Add Customer, OrderItem, and Order as dataclasses in domain/entities.py
- Define IOrderRepository and INotificationSender abstract interfaces
- Use built-in generics (list) instead of typing.List
- Remove unused imports and simplify type hints
- Structure domain layer with zero external dependencies

Establishes the foundation for SOLID + Clean Architecture implementation in Chapter 6.
